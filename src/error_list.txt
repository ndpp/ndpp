  NR /=0 ! Not an issue since interpolate_tab1 takes care of it.
  ERROR, INTT /= LINEAR_LINEAR ! Added routine to set what INTT was. Used the same code that interpolate_tab1 had.
  WARNING: Invalid Interpolation Grid Type ! Since we already did the integration of T (this came from law 7), then I think its safe to use lin-lin.

   WARNING: Energy Distribution Type 7 Has Nested EDISTs ! I think I have this fixed.
   - rxn % threshold for MT=20 does not match the first energy of its edist.
