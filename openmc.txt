NDPP is a work derived from OpenMC (https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc).  The
source code which does not have a filename matching ndpp_*.F90 is directly from 
the OpenMC repository without modification (as well as the code in xml-fortran
and the cross-section template in the templates directory).  If any of the
included files from OpenMC are updated by MIT-CRPG, then they can be copied over
and will likely work perfectly without modification. Of course, the test-suite
should be run after this manual merge is done.
