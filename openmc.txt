NDPP is a work derived from OpenMC (https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc).  The
source files pointed to by the omc_objects array in the src/OBJECTS file is
directly from the OpenMC repository without modification (as well as the 
code in xml-fortran and the cross-section template in the templates directory).
If any of the included files from OpenMC are updated by MIT-CRPG, then they 
can be copied over and will likely work perfectly without modification. Of 
course, the test-suite should be run after this manual merge is done.
