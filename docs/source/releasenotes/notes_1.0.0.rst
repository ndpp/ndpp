Release Notes for NDPP 1.0.0
============================

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

There are no special requirements for running the NDPP code other than
those required by the OpenMC code. As of this release, NDPP has
been tested on a variety of Linux distributions with an x86_64 architecture. 
Memory and processing power requirements will vary depending on the problem with 
the strongest factors being the number of neutron groups desired and the number 
of data points present in the ACE files.
